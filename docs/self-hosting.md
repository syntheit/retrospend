# Self-hosting

Run Retrospend on your own hardware with Docker Compose. You get the web app, the API for the mobile apps, scheduled jobs and backups. For running from source instead, see [development.md](development.md).

## Quick start

1. Get the config files:

   ```bash
   cp docker-compose.example.yml docker-compose.yml
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit `.env` and set the required variables (table below).

3. Start the services:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

The app is available on port `1997`. Migrations run automatically on startup.

### First run

- The first user to sign up becomes admin. You can restrict further signups to invite-only in the admin panel.
- If using Ollama for AI import, pull the model after first start:
  ```bash
  docker exec local-ollama ollama pull qwen2.5:7b
  ```
- The `ollama` service is optional. Remove it if you don't use bank statement import, or set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` to use a cloud model instead. Keep the `sidecar`: it also runs exchange rates, recurring expenses and backups.

## Settings

Set these in `.env`. Runtime settings are read at start; nothing is baked into the image.

| `FCM_PROJECT_ID` | No | from the key | Firebase project, if it differs from the key's |

## Mobile apps

The iPhone, iPad and Android apps connect to retrospend.app by default. To use your server, tap **Self-hosted** on the connect screen and enter your `PUBLIC_URL`. The apps use `/api/v1` on the same server, so no extra service is needed. Serve the app over HTTPS: plain HTTP works but the app warns about it.

## Push notifications

Optional. Without any of these settings the server sends no push and the apps check for changes when they open. Each sender below turns on by itself once all of its settings are present; a sender with a missing or unreadable setting stays off and says which setting it did not like in the server log.

A push says what happened and carries ids and an amount. It never carries an expense title, a note or a person's name, so nothing a push service relays can be read from it. Android pushes are also encrypted for the phone (RFC 8291).

- **Android without Google (UnifiedPush).** Install a distributor such as ntfy on the phone, then create a VAPID key pair once and set `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY` (the command is in `.env.example`). Keep the key: a new one makes every phone register again. The phone gives the server an endpoint on its distributor; the server will not connect to an endpoint on a private network (a phone on your LAN pointing at `192.168.x.x`, `localhost`, a name that resolves to one) unless you list its host in `PUSH_ENDPOINT_ALLOW_HOSTS` or an admin allows private targets for webhooks.
- **iPhone and iPad (APNs).** Create an APNs auth key in your Apple developer account and set `APNS_KEY_ID`, `APNS_TEAM_ID`, `APNS_BUNDLE_ID` and `APNS_KEY`. Builds signed for development use Apple's sandbox without a setting.
- **Android with Google Play services (FCM).** Set `FCM_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` to a Firebase service account key. Phones without Play services use UnifiedPush or check for changes themselves.

What is pushed: a shared expense added or changed on a split you are on, a payment recorded, confirmed, marked not received or waiting for your confirmation, a request to fix an expense, and a recurring expense or income that is due. A notification type you turned off in Settings (in-app) is not pushed either. A person gets at most 60 different pushes an hour.

## Files and volumes

- Uploaded files (avatars, project images) live in the `uploads` volume and finished exports in the `exports` volume. Back up `uploads` alongside your database.
- Use strong, unique values for `AUTH_SECRET` and `WORKER_API_KEY`.
- Put the app behind a reverse proxy or tunnel that terminates HTTPS, and set `PUBLIC_URL` to the public address.

## Backups

The sidecar service handles scheduled database backups on the schedule set by `BACKUP_CRON` (default: daily at 3 AM UTC). Retention is controlled by `BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS` (default: 30).

Backup files are written inside the sidecar container. To persist them on the host, mount a volume to `/app/backups`.

## Updating

1. Back up the database and the `uploads` volume.
2. Pull the new images: `docker compose pull`.
3. Restart: `docker compose up -d`. Migrations run on start.

Release notes for each version are on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/syntheit/retrospend/releases).
